# Git-use
Before using SVN, gitLab and other tools in the company project, they used fewer functions of GitHub, and then continued to update personal projects.

Most of the exercises I wrote before, including some summaries, were written in the locality. It is not easy to keep practicing and updating at multiple locations. Yesterday, I had the idea of maintaining my code on GitHub for updating and using.

It involves some operations of GIT, so this conclusion is made.
